I don't know happened, but long days feel short
we should apathetic in the work, instead we talk

Schedule is is over,  I'll see you instead
No more writing, I tuck you into my bed

Your skin looks so soft and that cute smile of yours
is all that I want a cold night in march

I hope but I wont throw the rope
help me, dare me to show want I should want
the night is young, <i>but our love could be old</i>

i don't about you, but I feel this strange thing
it was so long ago, till now I felt ice cold
but please be honest if the feelings I assume is wrong
Then I'll turn around my heart is hard, just a bit sore

I hope but I wont throw the rope
help me, dare me to show want I should want
the night is young, <i>but our love could be old</i>
